/**
 * This is value object. Value object must be immutable. Object values shouldnâ€™t be able to be altered over their
 * lifetime.
 *
 * Value Objects should be created through their constructors. In order to build one, you usually pass the required
 * primitive types or other Value Objects through this constructor. Value Objects are always in a valid state; thatâ€™s
 * why we create them in a single atomic step. Empty constructors with multiple setters and getters move the creation
 * responsibility to the client, resulting in the Anemic Domain Model, which is considered an anti-pattern.
 *
 * As you can see below there is private constructor because there is used semantic constructor ::create. It's because
 * PHP doesn't support __construct overloading (in contrast with e.g. Java) and therefore it's better design to have
 * multiple constructors (factory methods) with their semantic name.
